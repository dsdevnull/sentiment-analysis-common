# Sentiment Analysis Common Models
This is the models created from this [sentiment analysis common repo](https://github.com/dsdevnull/sentiment-analysis-common) that I created.

Right now this repo contains: Multinomial Naive Bayes model on top of a Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) ranking. Plus the Vectorizer used to fit the model.
